## Week 9

This week the data comes from the US [Department of Transporation](https://data-usdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/usdot::alternative-fueling-stations/about) and contains information on Alternative Fueling Stations in the USA as of 3 January 3 2022.

There are 67 attributes in the original data set, including address of alternative fuel station, opening hours, forms of payment, type of fuel etc. The data set used in #TidyTuesday also included an object ID and X and Y geospatial co-ordinates of the site for a total of 70 variables. A description of the variables is available [here](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download/alt_fuel_stations_format).

I analysed the type and frequency of alternative fuel used by state in the USA - a fairly simple analysis (see the R code file in this repository) which revealed interesting trends. 

Electricity is by far the most prevalent alternative fuel in the USA, with ethanol and propane coming in second. While all states use electricity, the distribution of ethanol and propane seems non-random. Ethanol is highly prevalent in the Midwest states. These states are also the major corn (maize) producers in the USA - a [good source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1106316/us-share-ethanol-production-by-feedstock-type/) for the production of bioethanol. According to the [USDA](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/u-s-bioenergy-statistics/) Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Minnesota, Indiana and South Dakota have the largest fuel ethanol production facilities by capacity. Iowa also has the largest biodiesel production capacity with 10 plants in the state, followed by California with 9, and Texas and Missouri with 8 each (_ibid_). Propane usage also seems fairly high in the Midwest, although the usage in Missouri and Montana seem particularly high. While propane is produced from liquid components recovered during natural gas processing, renewable propane is produced from biomass-based feedstocks (largely at biodiesel refineries). Therefore the frequency of usage in the corn-producing states again make sense. The USA is a [major exporter](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47036) of propane.
