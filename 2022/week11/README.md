## Week 11

This week the data comes from [Robert Flight's Github](https://github.com/rmflight/vignette_analysis), where he aimed to analyze the changes in the number of vignettes over time, in order to quantify the effect of knitr and rmarkdown. Two data sets are available: one for packages in CRAN and one for packages in Bioconductor. For each current and available package under the CRAN archive, Robert counted how many sweave and markdown vignettes were present. For Bioconductor, he counted how many of each vignette type was present at each commit.

The data sets can be accessed from the #TidyTuesday [Github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-03-15/readme.md) page.
