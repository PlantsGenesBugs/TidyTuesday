### Week 8

This week the data comes from [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/reports/publication-archives). This NGO conducts research and advocacy on democracy, political freedom, and human rights. They gather data on 7 main topics for each country:

*Political rights*
- Electoral Process: executive and legislative elections, and electoral framework (3 questions) 
- Political Pluralism and Participation: party system, competition, freedom to exercise political choices, and minority voting rights (4 questions)
- Functioning of Government: corruption, transparency, and ability of elected officials to govern in practice (3 questions)

*Civil liberties*
- Freedom of Expression and Belief: media, religious freedom, academic freedom, and free private discussion (4 questions)
- Associational and Organizational Rights: free assembly, civic groups, and labor unions (3 questions)
- Rule of Law: independent judges and prosecutors, due process, crime and disorder, and legal equality (4 questions)
- Personal Autonomy and Individual Rights: freedom of movement, property rights, personal and family rights, and freedom from economic exploitation (4 questions)

Each country or territory is awarded a score of 0 to 4 points for each of the 25 indicators (questions) listed above. A score of 0 represents the smallest degree of freedom and 4 the greatest degree of freedom.
