## Week 28

This week the data is from Eurocontrol's [Aviation Intelligence Unit Portal](https://ansperformance.eu/data/), which collates data about CO2 emissions by state, various operations en route and at airports, traffic complexity and economics. Eurostat used the data in September 2021 to assess the air transport industry's recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Flights in the EU show a very regular annual pattern. That is until around February 2020 when the number of (commercial) flights dropped dramatically. It recovered briefly in summer 2020 just to dip back down when the second wave of the pandemic occurred. At present, some airports are struggling to cope with resurgent demand. Heathrow in particular has had several weeks of [flight cancellations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62119420), long queues and baggage chaos. Some airline staff who were made redundant during the pandemic have gone on to pursue [other career pathways](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61830479). It's going to take some time for this industry to return to previous standards.

![A facetted line graph. Each facet represents a year from 2016 to 2022. On the x axis is the months of the year. On the Y axis is the total number of flights in the EU. A regular pattern is observed from 2016-2019 with the most flights in the summer months. In 2020 the number of flights drop dramatically. It briefly increases at the end of 2020 and then drops again in the first quarter of 2021 before showing a steady increase towards 2022. In 2022 the usual pattern seems to be followed again, but the number of flights are still lower than originally.](https://github.com/PlantsGenesBugs/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2022/week28/flights.png)
