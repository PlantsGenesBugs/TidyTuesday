This week we continue the #DuBoisChallenge2022 theme! The challenge rolls out over 10 weeks, with the aim of recreating 10 iconic visualisations created by W.E.B. DuBois for the 1900 Parix Exposition. You can read more about it on the [#TidyTuesday github page](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-02-15/readme.md).

We were also given the option to BYOD (Bring Your Own Data), so I decided to do just that. I collected data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) on the ethnicity of students enrolled at university/other higher ed for the past academic year. The data include students domiciled anywhere, in universities in any part of the UK, and at any level of study (undergrad or postgrad). HESA's own analysis of these numbers can be seen on the [source page](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/25-01-2022/sb262-higher-education-student-statistics/numbers).

The relative proportions are sort of reflective of the population make-up of the UK (in 2011, ethnicity in the UK was 87.2% white, 3% black, 4.2% Asian and 2% mixed), but I think there are deeper questions to be asked (are certain universities showing a bias? what about staff representation?)

In terms of preparing this graph, I had to hack it quite a bit. There are 2 graphs plotted over each other. One provides the background and annotations, the other provides the rotated bar. I couldn't quite figure out how to move the dot symbol of the legend to the opposite side of the legend text, and had already invested quite a lot of time on this. But overall, I've leared a lot again this week!
