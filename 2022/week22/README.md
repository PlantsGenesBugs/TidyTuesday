## Week 22

I've taken a small break from Tidy Tuesday due to work and other things (I'm aiming to cycle 600km in Finland this year - it requires quite a lot of training, both physically and navigationally!). But I wanted to dip back in because I realised my R skills were atrophying. So here we are... I used the data for week 22, although TidyTuesday has already rolled into week 23. I just found the data really interesting, so I will spend a bit of time analysing it.

The data for week 22 comes from the [Axios Harris Poll 100](https://theharrispoll.com/partners/media/axios-harrispoll-100/). The poll methodology itself is also quite interesting, although I have to admit I'm not a social scientist so my opinions are based on curiousity, not expertise. In a 2-step process the poll first identifies companies that have, according to respondents, very good or very bad reputations. This list of companies is then ranked in the second part of the process by a separate set of respondents. For step 1, a total number of 6,118 people were polled. Although they are selected to be representative of the entire USA, the number seems small to me. The second step employs 33,096 respondents (also selected to be a representative sample).

The Corporate Reputation Rankings therefore don't necessarily tell us which companies are most profitable or successful - no, the rankings tell us which companies are either very good at marketing, or stick in people's minds because of exceptional service (either good or bad), or for controversy surrounding the brand. 

My first overview of the data revealed that of the different sectors of industry included in the poll, retail businesses are foremost in people's minds. In fact, retail business has dominated this poll since 2017, with the number of businesses in other sectors remaining constant annually in the poll. I imagine this reflects the frequency with which people interact with different sectors of industry. 

The obvious next question is: which companies are included in the poll and how have their rankings changed over time? The nature of the first step of the poll would suggest that the companies in each sector will rank either very high or very low. But will companies manage to change rank? Or disappear entirely off the poll? I'll answer that in a follow-up post next week.
