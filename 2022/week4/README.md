This week the data was provided by [Board Games Geek](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/) - with credit to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jvanelteren/boardgamegeek-reviews/version/3?select=2022-01-08.csv) and [David & Georgios](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/382#issuecomment-1020305849).

Board Games Geek (BGG) is an online resource for all things board and card game! The website contains reviews, ratings, images, play-aids, translations and session reports. It's also a hub for game trading. BGG makes its game data available for analysis and provides helpful advice about how to [obtain this](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Data_Mining#). Luckily for the TidyTuesday-ers, we have been provided with a pre-made dataset, available, as always, from the [mothership](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-01-25/readme.md).

The data in the database consists of two .CSV files. One contains ratings data, the other contains details of the games. I am a closet Scrabble fan. I'd probably play it more if I could find someone to play with. The game holds fond memories of games I played with friends in the past, as well as games I played with my dad before he passed away. So I wanted to know if the mighty Scrabble featured in this database which, of course, it did. I then had two follow-up questions: 

1. How many word games are there?
2. How many other games did the creator of Scrabble design?

The answer to question one turns out to be: about 1 word game for every 1000 other types of games. I suppose this isn't surprising seeing as word games provide a fairly limited arena to work in. The answer to question 2 was surprising: Alfred Mosher Butts (an architect by training) designed only 2 games ever, and they were both Word Games. The first was Scrabble (he considered the names "Lexiko", "Criss Cross Words" and "It" before settling on the now-famous title). The other was simply called "Alfreds Other Game". There is a great [photo of Alfred](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/422606/alfreds-other-game) on the cover of his "Other Game" at BGG.
