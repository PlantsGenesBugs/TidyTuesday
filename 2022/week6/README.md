## Week 6

This week #TidyTuesday has joined the [Tuskegee Airmen Challenge](https://github.com/lang1023/Tuskegee-Airman-Challenge/blob/main/Tuskegee%20Airmen%20Challenge.xlsx) using data sourced from the Commemorative Air Force. The data set details the African American pilots who were the first ever African American aviators in the US Armed Forces.

There is a wealth of knowledge over at the Tidy Tuesday Github. I found myself chasing down many rabbit holes for incredible stories, such as the incredible life of Welton Taylor who was a Liaison pilot. Liaison pilots were the glue that held things together during WWII - Taylor used air surveillance to help direct field artillery fire. Liaison pilots were, themselves, unarmed. After the war, Taylor went on to complete a PhD in microbiology. If you work in a microbiology lab, you might be familiar with the nutrient agar that Taylor developed for the study of *Salmonella* and *Shigella* baterial species: XLD agar.

In addition to honouring the Tuskegee Airmen, Tidy Tuesday is hooking in with the W.E.B. DuBois challenge, which is live for 10 weeks. W.E.B DuBois (1868-1963) was an incredible historian, sociologist, civil rights activist, author and many other things. His striking data visualisations about the life of African Americans during his lifetime show a great skill in conveying information through graphics.

I wanted to produce 2 graphs this week: one a reproduction of W.E.B. DuBois' wonderful spiral graph, using the Tuskegee Airmen Challenge data set. This proved too hard to do in a couple of days, and so I'll leave that as a long-term project and Tweet when I've succeeded (**UPDATE: NOW ADDED. See below!**). The second graph I wanted to do was one looking at the number of aerial victories of the Tuskegee Airmen during WWII, using a DuBois-inspired palette. Below you can see my analysis. There are some values missing as I removed missing values from some fields. However, one name appears more than once: 2nd Lt. Edward L Toppins. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_L._Toppins): "Toppins is considered one of the best pilots to have emerged from the Tuskegee program. He earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with 5 clusters, a Victory Medal, an Eastern Theater Offensive Ribbon with 7 battle stars, and an American Defense recognition. Known among by his peers as a "pilot's pilot" and "almost a daredevil," Toppins completed 141 missions, destroying four enemy aircraft with one probable."

### Spiral Graph

This graph was quite a struggle, but thanks to stumbling on the awesome code of [Charlie Gallagher](https://github.com/charlie-gallagher/tidy-tuesday/blob/master/dubois/dubois.R), I managed to complete it! The value of a single revolution is defined as a specific number (somewhere midway of the largest X-value in the data set so that the higher numbers require > 1 revolution to reach max value). Then for each categorical variable there are two X co-ordinates (0 and the value of that category; this determines the length of the line) and related Y co-ordinates (that determine the vertical position at start and end of the line). Initially all X == 0 values are assigned a Y value of 2. This is arbitrary. However, this value has to be adjusted to ensure that all lines lie underneath each other at X == 0. Mock data is added and used for adjustment so that each categorical variable starts below the other, and the final Y position is appropriate. One revolution decreases the y value by 1, so that a spiral is created if an X value extends beyond 1 revolution. The final Y co-ordinate is calculated based on the X value for that particular revolution, as a proportion of the value for a whole revolution. Code for this is available in the file "20220208 TuskegeeAirmen-part2.R", but Charlie also has a great minimal working example in his code, so I encourage you to check it out!

![Radial graph, in the shape of concentric spirals. The graph shows the number of graduates of different ranks in the Tuskegee Airmen crew. The smalles number is represented by Captains (2 individuals), with 1st lieutenants at 28, flight officers at 279 and 2nd lietuenants at 688. Each class of graduate has it's own colour. The length of the ribbon stretching around the spiral equals the number of individuals in the group.](https://github.com/PlantsGenesBugs/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2022/week6/TuskegeeAirmen2.png)
