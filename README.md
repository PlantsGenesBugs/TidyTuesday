# TidyTuesday
TidyTuesday is a weekly project from the R 4 DataScience community to encourage people to learn and play with R. All of the information about the project can be read at the official [TidyTuesday github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) maintained by Thomas Mock. You can follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock) for more R content.

One of the bits of advice I received as a new (and sporadic) user of R is to get involved in Tidy Tuesday. So here are my attempts. I realise the code will be less than polished and in a few years time I'll probably cringe when I look back, but practice really is the best way to learn, so here I go.

Each week will have its own folder inside the respective annual folder (optimistic that this will become a multi-year endeavour!). The files might contain a bit more code and analysis than I share on Twitter, depending on how much time I have to spend smooshing the data around.
