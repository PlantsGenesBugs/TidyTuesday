## Week 7 - Hollywood Age Gaps

This week the data come from [Hollywood Age Gap](https://hollywoodagegap.com/) via [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2018-02-07-edition/). The data show the ages of actors who played the roles of romantic couples in Hollywood movies (note: NOT the ages of the characters themselves!).

Most of the movie relationships (941) featured an older man and a woman as younger partner (929), although there were 12 movie relationships between and older man and a younger man. There were 214 movie relationships featuring an older woman, with most of them being heterosexual relationships (203) and a small number featuring a woman as younger partner (11).

The average age for an older male romantic partner is 42, with an average age difference of 12 years compared to the younger partner. When a woman is the older romantic partner, the average age of the actor in that role is just over 36, with an average age difference of 5 years between them and the younger romantic partner.

In the graphs below, movies are highlighted where the older actor is aged 60 or older and the age difference is greater than 30 years (i.e. the younger partner is at least 30 years younger). There are 15 movies that satisfy these conditions when a man is the older character, and only 2 when a woman is the older character.
