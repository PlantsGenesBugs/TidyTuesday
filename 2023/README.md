### TidyTuesday repository for 2023

I will aim to have another go at speed-TT this year! The goal will be to do as much data analysis in as short a time period as possible (to keep myself from endless data rumination). I will also give the folders for each week much more descriptive names so it's easier to idenfity the content.

Data comes from the R4DS [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/) Github as always.
