## Week 4 - Alone

This week's Tidy Tuesday looks at the US TV series "Alone". I don't think I could explain the series any better than Sian Cain ([@siancain](https://twitter.com/siancain)), so here is a quote from her article in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/25/alone-sounds-like-the-worst-reality-tv-but-actually-brilliant):

> Have you ever wanted to see a US soldier bricking himself because he thinks he’s heard a bear? Of course you have. We all have. Thankfully, some benevolent television executive clocked that and made Alone for us: 10 people are dumped in the wilderness, completely alone (geddit), competing to see who can survive the longest and win US$500,000. Here’s the kicker: none of the contestants know how well anyone else is doing, so they have to just keep going until everyone else drops out. 

The [data package](https://github.com/doehm/alone) was created by [Dan Oehm](https://twitter.com/danoehm) and contains a wealth of information about contestants, their track record in the show, informatio about the episodes and also the location of each season. Full details are on the [TidyTuesday Github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-01-24/readme.md).

As part of my "speedTT" effort this year I decided to do a very, very quick analysis. Well, actually, no, I tried a few things and landed on the graph that gave the most information and allowed me to play with visualisation. I wanted to use an image for the plot's background and really liked the image used for [Season 2](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/alone/s02). However, to avoid copyright issues I asked [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) to create a similar image for me using the description "A bird's eye view of a forest of spruce pines in shades of green and blue, with a slight ist hanging over it, digital art". It actually produced something really close!
