## Week 4 - Alone

This week's Tidy Tuesday looks at the US TV series "Alone". I don't think I could explain the series any better than Sian Cain ([@siancain](https://twitter.com/siancain)), so here is a quote from her article in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/25/alone-sounds-like-the-worst-reality-tv-but-actually-brilliant):

> Have you ever wanted to see a US soldier bricking himself because he thinks he’s heard a bear? Of course you have. We all have. Thankfully, some benevolent television executive clocked that and made Alone for us: 10 people are dumped in the wilderness, completely alone (geddit), competing to see who can survive the longest and win US$500,000. Here’s the kicker: none of the contestants know how well anyone else is doing, so they have to just keep going until everyone else drops out. 

The [data package](https://github.com/doehm/alone) was created by [Dan Oehm](https://twitter.com/danoehm) and contains a wealth of information about contestants, their track record in the show, informatio about the episodes and also the location of each season. Full details are on the [TidyTuesday Github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-01-24/readme.md).

As part of my "speedTT" effort this year I decided to do a very, very quick analysis. Well, actually, no, I tried a few things and landed on the graph that gave the most information and allowed me to play with visualisation. I wanted to use an image for the plot's background and really liked the image used for [Season 2](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/alone/s02). However, to avoid copyright issues I asked [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) to create a similar image for me using the description "A bird's eye view of a forest of spruce pines in shades of green and blue, with a slight ist hanging over it, digital art". It actually produced something really close! 

The pattern revealed by the graph below is interesting, because it seems to suggest that the fewer people who watch Alone, the higher it gets rated. From season 1 (first aired in 2015) the number of viewers decreased season-on-season to season 6 (aired in 2019). Then in season 7 there was an increase in viewers and the ratings also went up. I wonder if the 2020 pandemic had anything to do with it? Watching TV series' seemed to be a [coping](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.599859/full) [strategy](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15213269.2022.2142244) [during](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Ryle-Blanco/publication/360797478_MENTAL_HEALTH_AND_ESCAPISM_THROUGH_TV_SHOW_CONSUMPTION_AMONG_FILIPINO_UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENTS_WHILE_ON_COVID-19_COMMUNITY_QUARANTINE/links/628c1e8ac962e566ee84ae85/MENTAL-HEALTH-AND-ESCAPISM-THROUGH-TV-SHOW-CONSUMPTION-AMONG-FILIPINO-UNDERGRADUATE-STUDENTS-WHILE-ON-COVID-19-COMMUNITY-QUARANTINE.pdf) the pandemic, and I certainly found the draw of watching lots of adventure videos and escapist programmes. Regardless, the premise of the show looks interesting and season 7 is definitely one to watch out for!

They are shaded according to the IMDB rating of each episode. The number of viewers decrease over time reaching a minimal amount on average in season 6, before going up again in seasons 7 and 8. The highest viewing figures are seen in season 1 and 3. The highest rated episodes are seen in season 6 - only one episode rating highest - and in season 7 where several episodes are rated highly. The minimum score is 6.9 and the maximum is 8.8](https://github.com/PlantsGenesBugs/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2023/week%204%20-%20Alone/Alone.png)
