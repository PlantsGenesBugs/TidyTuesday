## Week 3 - Art History

This week's TidyTuesday looks at the demographics of artists covered in two widely used art textbooks: Janson’s History of Art and Gardner’s Art Through the Ages. The data set combines the appearance of artists in both books. 

For my first TT of the year, I did a quick breakdown of artists by gender and by race. I noticed that the overall pattern was very similar (male artists == white artists) so I took the artistic (ahem) decision of placing the graphs next to each other in a mirror-image fashion, so that the overall profile looks like a [rhinoceros beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynastinae). It doesn't convey any additional information besides being akin to one of those "what do you see, a woman or a vase?" type images - it looks pleasing!

There is a large spike in white representation between 1985 and 2000 which creates an arc. This then drops back down to lower values. Other races never count for more than 25 appearances in these textbooks in any year. The highest number of appearances for white artists is about 325 in 2002 or thereabouts.](https://github.com/PlantsGenesBugs/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2023/week%203%20-%20artist%20demographics/raceArt.png)

The two arcs created by the graphs looks like the antlers of a rhinoceros beetle.](https://github.com/PlantsGenesBugs/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2023/week%203%20-%20artist%20demographics/beetleArt2.png)
