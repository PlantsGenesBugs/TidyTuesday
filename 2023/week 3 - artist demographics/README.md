## Week 3 - Art History

This week's TidyTuesday looks at the demographics of artists covered in two widely used art textbooks: Janson’s History of Art and Gardner’s Art Through the Ages. The data set combines the appearance of artists in both books. 

For my first TT of the year, I did a quick breakdown of artists by gender and by race. I noticed that the overall pattern was very similar (male artists == white artists) so I took the artistic (ahem) decision of placing the graphs next to each other in a mirror-image fashion, so that the overall profile looks like a scarab beetle. It doesn't convey any additional information besides being akin to one of those "what do you see, a woman or a vase?" type images.
